# Overview

The Player contract defines a metadata standard that allows a user to declare a certain NFT as a player with on-chain or proof-on-chain stats, equipment, and backpack. The NFT then can hold it’s own items, have it’s own internal state, and can be consumed by composing with other contracts. The Player contract also knows how to use the Item contract to have items be used with a player’s stats.
