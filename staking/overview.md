# Overview

In the Raindrops Protocol, both [Items](../item/overview.md) and [Players](../player/overview.md) can be staked by valid whitelist mints in a given [Namespace](../namespace/overview.md).&#x20;

When they are staked, their stats or effects can be scaled up by defined multipliers in their definitions. This allows tokens to have true utility by allowing gamers to stake them against their in-game artifacts with well-defined warmup and cooldown periods to create more powerful players and/or items.

While the staking parameters are defined in the [Player](../player/overview.md) and [Item](../item/overview.md) contract, the actual staking mechanics are carried out by this contract.
