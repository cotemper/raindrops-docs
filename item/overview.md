# Overview

The goal of the item contract is to decorate existing NFTs as in-game items that can be consumed, destroyed, warmed up, cooled down, and constructed based on recipes (similar to the Metaplex Fireball contract). This additional metadata on top of NFTs can be consumed by other contracts that compose with the item contract for easy out of the box functionality through validations and callbacks.
