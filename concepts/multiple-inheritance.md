# Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritance is explicitly **not supported** to keep things simple, _except_ in [Namespaces](broken-reference), where a single `Namespace` can be part of many other parent `Namespace`s. This is much more similar to a Mixin however, as namespaces do not inherit from a parent.
